## Task 1

Create a function that accomplishes the following:

Given an array of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`), the function should return the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

Assumptions:
- Each input will have exactly one solution.
- The same element cannot be used twice.
- The answer can be returned in any order.

Please also provide the Time and Space Complexity of your solution.

Constraints:
- The length of `nums` should be between 2 and 10^4.
- The values of `nums[i]` and `target` should be between -10^9 and 10^9.
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Task 2

Create a function that accomplishes the following:

Given an array (`prices`), where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day, the function should return the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying one stock on one day and selling it on a different day in the future.

If no profit can be achieved, the function should return 0.

Please also provide the Time and Space Complexity of your solution.

Constraints:
- The length of `prices` should be between 1 and 10^5.
- The values of `prices[i]` should be between 0 and 10^4.
