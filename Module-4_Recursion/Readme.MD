# Assignment on Recursion

## Task 1:

### Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

#### The input string is given as a string ‘s’.

#### You must use Recursion to solve the problem.

Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105

#### Example 1:

Input: s = "madam"
Output: true

#### Example 2:

Input: s = "adam"
Output: false

#### Example 3:

Input: s = "tenet"
Output: true

## Task 2:

### Write a recursive function to multiply given two positive integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ without using the * operator (multiplication operator). You can only use + operator (addition operator) and - operator (subtraction operator).

Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution

Constraints:
1 <= a, b <= 105

#### Example 1:
Input: a = 4, b = 5
Output: 20

#### Example 2:
Input: a = 3, b = 3
Output: 9

#### Example 3:
Input: a = 0, b = 2
Output: 0
